# Spree Internationalization

This is a fork of the Internationalization project for [Spree Commerce](http://spreecommerce.com/).
It contains updated Dutch translations. Now that the Spree I18N on localeapp.com is almost complete,
the only differences you'll find here have to do with subculture form in Dutch.
The official Spree translations use the informal "je" form, this translation uses the more formal "u/uw" form.

1. Add the following to your Gemfile
<pre>
  gem 'spree_i18n', :git => 'https://github.com/driehuis/spree_i18n.git'
</pre>
2. Run `bundle install`
